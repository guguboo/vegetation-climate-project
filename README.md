# Vegetation-Climate Project

## Overview
The **Vegetation-Climate** project aims to analyze the relationship between vegetation growth and climatic changes, focusing on how variations in climate impact different types of vegetation. The project involves collecting and analyzing historical satellite data and using machine learning models to predict future changes in vegetation patterns. This is particularly useful for developing strategies to adapt agricultural practices and improve food security under changing climate conditions.

## Objectives
- **Analyze the impact of climate change on vegetation**: Study how climatic variables like temperature, rainfall, and humidity affect the growth cycles of various plant species.
- **Develop predictive models**: Use historical data to develop models that can forecast the effects of different climate scenarios on vegetation health and productivity.
- **Support sustainable agriculture**: Provide insights for optimal planting and harvesting times, which can be utilized by local and regional authorities as well as farmers.

## Features
1. **Data Visualization**: Display satellite data over time to visualize the progression of vegetation cover.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Generate statistics on changes in vegetation indices such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index).
3. **Predictive Insights**: Offer recommendations for optimal planting times based on climate data, helping farmers maximize yield while minimizing environmental impact.
4. **Climate Impact Maps**: Create visual maps of regions that are most affected by changing climatic conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Google Earth Engine (GEE)**: To process and visualize satellite imagery.
- **Python**: For data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Such as TensorFlow or PyTorch to develop predictive models.
- **GIS Tools**: Geographic Information System tools to analyze spatial data.
- **Next.js & React**: For creating interactive dashboards to display insights.

## Data Sources
- **Sentinel and Landsat Satellite Data**: Historical data to analyze vegetation patterns.
- **Weather Data**: Collected from various sources like BMKG (Indonesian Meteorological Agency) and AccuWeather for historical and real-time climate information.
- **Ground-Truth Data**: Collected from government and local authorities for validation purposes.
